I am a computational biologist at the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) in Warsaw, Poland. My research is focused on developing and applying advanced computational methods to unravel the complexities of RNA structure and function. I leverage tools from biophysics, computer science, and molecular biology to build predictive models and accessible software for the scientific community.

ðŸ”¬ **My current research interests include:**
-   Integrative modeling of biomolecular structures using cryo-EM and SAXS data.
-   Developing machine learning approaches for RNA structure prediction (RNA-Puzzles, CASP).
-   Understanding the physicochemical basis of protein-RNA interactions.

ðŸ’» **My core technical skills:**
-   **Modeling & Simulation:** Molecular Dynamics (Amber), Monte Carlo (SimRNA), Macromolecular Docking
-   **Programming:** Python, Bash, C++, R
-   **Data Science & ML:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas
-   **Workflow Management:** Snakemake, Nextflow
-   **Tools:** Git, Linux, HPC environments
